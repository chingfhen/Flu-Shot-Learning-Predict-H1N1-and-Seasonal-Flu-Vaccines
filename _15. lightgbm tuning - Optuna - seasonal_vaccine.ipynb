    "- this notebooks:\n",
    "    - optimizes parameters with Optuna with a pruner that observes intermediate results and stop unpromising trials.\n",
    "    - Approach:\n",
    "        1. Fix at a high-ish learning rate and at a fixed iteration\n",
    "        2. perform Hyperparameter Search\n",
    "        3. Using the best parameters found, reduce learning rate and find the best iteration using early stopping\n",
    "- insights:\n",
    "    - **the above approach is effective** - gains are usually seen in step 3"
